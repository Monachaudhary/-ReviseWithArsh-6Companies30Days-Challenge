<h1> FAANG Coding Interview Questions</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains a curated set of coding questions often asked in technical interviews at top tech companies, commonly known as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). These questions are designed to help you prepare for coding interviews and enhance your problem-solving skills.

<h3>Questions</h3>

Two Sum

**Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
Example: Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9; Output: [0, 1]
Maximum Subarray

**Problem Statement:** Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]; Output: 6 (subarray [4,-1,2,1])
Merge Intervals

**Problem Statement:** Merge overlapping intervals.
Example: Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]; Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

**Problem Statement:** Find the maximum path sum between two nodes in a binary tree.
Example: Input: [-10, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]; Output: 42
LRU Cache

**Problem Statement:** Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
Example: cache = LRUCache(2); cache.put(1, 1); cache.put(2, 2); cache.get(1); // returns 1;
Word Ladder

**Problem Statement:** Transform the word "start" to "end" by changing only one letter at a time, with each transformed word being a valid word from a given word list.
Example: start = "hit"; end = "cog"; wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]; Output: 5
